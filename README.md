# Random Number Guesser Game (CLI + SQLAlchemy ORM)

A terminal-based number guessing game built with Python that uses SQLAlchemy ORM to track users, games, and guesses in a database. This project demonstrates core CLI functionality, database relationships, and object-oriented design.

---

## Features

- CLI interface for playing the number guessing game.
- Tracks player profiles and their game history.
- Stores guesses and calculates the number of attempts.
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage and persist data.
- Modular project structure with best practices.
- Pipenv for dependency and virtual environment management.

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to create a username**, so I can save and track my game history.
2. **As a user, I want to receive feedback on each guess**, so I know if I’m getting closer.
3. **As a user, I want to know how many attempts I used**, so I can track my performance.

##  Database Models

- **User**: Represents a player.
- **Game**: Represents an instance of a game played by a user.
- **Guess**: Tracks individual guesses made in each game.

### Relationships:
- A `User` has many `Games`
- A `Game` has many `Guesses`

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite (default database)
- Pipenv (virtual environment & package management)
